# stock_price_predictor
This project predicts the next day's stock price using historical data and Support Vector Regression (SVR). It integrates an interactive GUI built with `ipywidgets` in a Jupyter notebook for easy user input, such as stock tickers and date ranges. The model leverages features like moving averages and volume change from Yahoo Finance data.
